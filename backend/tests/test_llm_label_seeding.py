"""init_label_series must seed the LLM duration histogram alongside the LLM
counters. Prometheus reports increase() of a series that appears mid-window
at value 1 as 0, so the first call per operation after a restart was invisible
on the duration panel while requests and errors, which are seeded, showed it.
